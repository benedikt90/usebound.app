## 🔒 What is UseBound?

UseBound is a **100% client-side document watermarking tool** that helps you protect sensitive documents before sharing them. Add visible, purpose-bound watermarks to PDFs and images directly in your browser—no uploads, no tracking, complete privacy.

## 🎯 The Problem It Solves

When you share sensitive documents (IDs, passports, contracts, financial records), you lose control once they're uploaded. If they leak in a data breach, there's no way to prove misuse or track the source. Documents can be used for identity theft, fraud, or unauthorized purposes without consequence.

## ✨ The Solution

UseBound adds visible watermarks that state:
- **WHO** the document is for (recipient/organization)
- **WHAT** it's for (purpose: job application, account opening, etc.)
- **WHEN** it expires (time-limited validity)

This creates built-in accountability. If the document appears in a hacked database:
- ✅ The watermark makes it useless for identity theft (clearly marked as bound to specific use)
- ✅ You know exactly which organization leaked it (accountability)
- ✅ You have proof of the intended purpose (legal protection)

## 🚀 Key Features

### Privacy First
- **100% client-side processing** - Documents never leave your browser
- **No uploads, no servers** - Everything happens locally
- **No tracking or analytics** - Your privacy is respected
- **Offline capable** - Works without internet after initial load
- **Open for verification** - Check Network tab in DevTools (zero requests)

### Powerful & Easy to Use
- **PDF & Image Support** - PNG, JPG, and multi-page PDFs
- **Customizable Watermarks** - Text, position, size, rotation, opacity, color
- **Template System** - Save and reuse common watermark configurations
- **Batch Processing** - Apply watermarks to multiple pages
- **Live Preview** - See exactly how your watermark will look
- **Touch-Friendly** - Optimized for mobile devices with larger handles

### Professional Features
- **Multi-page PDF** - Watermark all pages or specific pages
- **Metadata Stripping** - Optionally remove EXIF data on export
- **High Quality Output** - Maintains document quality
- **Keyboard Shortcuts** - Fast workflow with hotkeys
- **Responsive Design** - Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile

## 📋 Primary Use Cases

### 3. Financial Documents
